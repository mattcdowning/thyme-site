Thyme is a minimal [Sage-based](https://github.com/roots/sage) WordPress starter theme built with HTML5 Boilerplate, gulp, npm, and PostCSS that supports both [Basscss](https://github.com/basscss/basscss) and [Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons) for smoking fast, composable themes. The purpose of this project is to bring the principles of Functional CSS to the WordPress &#127758;.

## Theme installation


### via WordPress Admin Panel

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/jchck/project-x) of Thyme.
2. In your WordPress admin panel, navigate to Appearance->Themes
3. Click Add New
4. Click Upload Theme
5. Upload the zip file that you downloaded.

## Theme setup

Edit `lib/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, post formats, and sidebars.

## Theme development

Thyme uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build system and [npm](http://npmjs.com/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install gulp 

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

From the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) globally with `npm install -g gulp`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Available gulp commands

* `gulp` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `gulp watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `gulp --production` — Compile assets for production (no source maps).

### Using BrowserSync

To use BrowserSync during `gulp watch` you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `assets/manifest.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

For example, if your local development URL is `http://project-name.dev` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://project-name.dev"
  }
...
```
If your local development URL looks like `http://localhost:8888/project-name/` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://localhost:8888/project-name/"
  }
...
```
